Problem: proximal phalanxes of index..little collide with the palm when closing the hand completely
Simple solution:
[1] change masks such that the last bit of knuckles (also thumb) is 1 and all other zeros (0x1)
[2] change masks such that the last but one bit of proximal (only index..little) phalanxes is 1 and all other zeros (0x2)
[3] change all other masks to have four trailing zero bits (0x****0)
[4] change selfCollide properties of links from [1] to false (this is NOT necessary, but in this way some useless collision checks can be avoided)
